# AdventOfCode2021

My own take on this year's Advent of Code ([Link](https://adventofcode.com/)).

Mostly written in Javascript, unless some task is suited way better for another language.

Will try to solve most of the tasks without the use of any NPM Modules and using pure JS/Node.JS.

Folder structure as follows:
>DayX/TaskX/*.js as well as DayX/TaskX/data.txt for input data.

All files should be runable using a standard installation of Node.JS.
